All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code

Grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

There were some hits for `net`, but they were related to serialization and
not actually opening any connections or anything like that.

There were 2 hits of `unsafe` when grepping:
* In `fn as_str` in `impl Buf`
* In `fn serialize` in `impl Serialize for net::Ipv4Addr`

Unsafe review comments can be found in https://crrev.com/c/5350573/2 (this

Most of the crate is code to parse and validate the output of `rustc -vV`. The caller can
choose which `rustc` to use, or can use `rustc_version::{version, version_meta}` which will
try `$RUSTC` followed by `rustc`.

If an adversary can arbitrarily set the `$RUSTC` environment variable then this crate will
execute arbitrary code. But when this crate is used within a build script, `$RUSTC` should
be set correctly by `cargo`.
