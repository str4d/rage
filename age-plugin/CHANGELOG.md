# Changelog
All notable changes to the age crate will be documented in this file. Changes
to the [age-core crate](../age-core/CHANGELOG.md) also apply to the age-plugin
crate, and are not duplicated here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). All versions prior
to 1.0.0 are beta releases.
